**page_8**: Based on the provided image of page 8 from the PDF, there are no figures present on this page. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the quality of figures based on the criteria you've outlined. Here is the confirmation:

- **Figures on Page 8:** There are no figures on page 8.

Since there are no figures to evaluate, I will not address the specific criteria you've listed. If you have another page with figures or if this was a mistake, please provide the correct page or clarify your request.

**page_9**: Based on the provided image of page 9 from the PDF, here is an evaluation of the figures:

1. **Consistency in Style**:
   - The figures on this page do not use a completely consistent style. Figure 2 has a different layout and presentation compared to Figure 3. Figure 2 uses a line plot while Figure 3 uses a bar chart. The overall design elements (like font, line thickness, etc.) appear similar but not identical.

2. **X-axis, Y-axis Labels, Legends, and Ticks**:
   - **Figure 2**: 
     - X-axis: "Number of processes" with font size and capitalization consistent.
     - Y-axis: "K" with font size and capitalization consistent.
     - Legend: Positioned inside the plot, which might be less readable. Font size seems consistent with labels.
   - **Figure 3**: 
     - X-axis: "Number of processes" with font size and capitalization consistent.

     - Legend: Positioned outside the plot, which is better for readability. Font size seems consistent with labels.
   - Suggestion: Ensure that the legends are consistently placed (preferably outside for readability) and that font sizes are uniform across figures.

3. **Figure Title**:
   - **Figure 2**: "The profit for various values of k. The relative performance for different strategies."
   - **Figure 3**: "The profit for various values of k. The relative performance for different strategies."
   - Both titles are descriptive but could be more specific regarding what "profit" refers to in the context of the study.

4. **Key/Legend Order**:
   - **Figure 2**: The order of the legend matches the order of lines in the plot.
   - **Figure 3**: The order of the legend matches the order of bars in the plot.
   - Both figures seem to follow this guideline.

5. **Consistent Coloring Scheme and Patterns**:
   - Both figures use similar color schemes, but they do not use patterns in addition to colors, which could help distinguish elements when printed in black and white.
   - Suggestion: Add patterns (hatching, dots, etc.) to differentiate between different data series.

6. **Figure Captions**:
   - Captions are somewhat detailed but could be improved:
     - **Figure 2**: "The profit for various values of k. The relative performance for different strategies."
     - **Figure 3**: "The profit for various values of k. The relative performance for different strategies."
   - Suggestion: Include more details like the machine used, the specific number of processes/cores/GPUs if relevant, and any other pertinent experimental conditions.

7. **Figures Referenced in Text**:
   - The text does reference the figures, but it's not clear from the snippet provided how detailed the explanation is regarding how to read the figures and what to take away from them.
   - Suggestion: Ensure that the text provides a clear explanation of what each figure shows and what conclusions can be drawn from them.

8. **Figure Placement**:
   - The figures appear to be placed close to where they are mentioned in the text, which is good practice. However, without seeing the entire document, it's hard to confirm if they are placed immediately after their mention using `[h]`.

**General Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Standardize the placement of legends for better readability.
- Add patterns to the data series for clarity in black and white prints.
- Enhance figure captions with more experimental details.
- Ensure text around figures provides clear guidance on interpretation and takeaways.
- Consider aligning the visual style of figures more closely for a uniform look across the document.

**page_10**: Based on the provided image of page 10 from the PDF, here is an evaluation of the quality of the figures:

- **Figure 2**: Speedup and Efficiency for OpenMP and MPI.
- **Figure 3**: GPU and CPU performance for the parallel sum.

### Evaluation:

1. **Consistent Style**:
   - The figures do not use a completely consistent style. Figure 1 and Figure 2 are bar charts, while Figure 3 is a heatmap, which is a different style. However, within the bar charts, there is consistency.

2. **X-axis, Y-axis Labels, Legends, and Ticks**:
   - **Figure 1**: 
     - X-axis: "Problem Type" with categories like CL10, CL10B, etc. Font size is readable, but capitalization is inconsistent (e.g., "graph500" vs "Graph500").
     - Y-axis: "petaFLOP/s" with readable font size.
     - Legend: Consistent with bar order, font size is small but readable.
   - **Figure 2**: 
     - X-axis: "Number of Threads" with readable font size.
     - Y-axis: "Speedup" and "Efficiency" with readable font size.
     - Legend: Consistent with bar order, font size is small but readable.
   - **Figure 3**: 
     - X-axis and Y-axis: Both labeled with "Threads", readable font size.
     - No legend needed for heatmap.

3. **Figure Title**:
   - **Figure 1**: "CL10 for each problem type. The LMs are best at best at transform problems, while they are worst at sparse linear algebra." - This title is somewhat descriptive but could be clearer.
   - **Figure 2**: "Speedup and Efficiency for OpenMP and MPI." - This title is descriptive.
   - **Figure 3**: "GPU and CPU performance for the parallel sum." - This title is descriptive.

4. **Key/Legend Order**:
   - The order in Figures 1 and 2 is consistent with the order of the bars/lines in the figures.

5. **Coloring Scheme and Patterns**:
   - Figures use consistent colors, but there are no patterns in addition to colors. Adding patterns could help with visibility in black-and-white prints.

6. **Figure Captions**:
   - **Figure 1**: Detailed caption mentioning the problem types and the performance of LMs.
   - **Figure 2**: Detailed caption explaining the context of OpenMP and MPI, and the significance of speedup and efficiency.
   - **Figure 3**: Detailed caption explaining the performance comparison between GPU and CPU.

7. **Reference in Text**:
   - The figures are referenced in the text with explanations on how to read them and what to take away. For example, the text discusses the performance results shown in the figures and provides context.

8. **Figure Placement**:
   - The figures appear to be placed right after they are mentioned in the text, which is appropriate.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Consistent Style**: Consider using similar visual styles for related data (e.g., if performance comparisons are common, stick to bar charts or line graphs).

2. **Label Consistency**: Ensure consistent capitalization in labels (e.g., "Graph500" vs "graph500").

3. **Figure Titles**: Make titles more concise and focused on the key takeaway. For example, "Performance of LMs Across Different Problem Types" for Figure 1.

4. **Patterns**: Add patterns to the bars or lines in addition to colors to enhance readability in grayscale or for colorblind readers.

5. **Font Size**: Ensure all text in figures is large enough to be easily readable, particularly legends which are often too small.

6. **Additional Context in Captions**: If multiple machines or configurations are used, specify this in the captions if not clear from the figure itself.

Overall, the figures are well-presented, but minor adjustments could enhance clarity and consistency.

**page_11**: Based on the provided image of page 11 from the PDF, there are three figures present. Here is an evaluation based on the criteria you provided:

1. **Consistent Style**:
   - The figures generally follow a consistent style in terms of layout and presentation. However, Figure 2 has a different style compared to Figures 1 and 3, which are more similar to each other.

2. **X-axis, Y-axis Labels, Legends, and Ticks**:
   - **Figure 1**: Labels are clear, but the font size seems small. Capitalization and units are consistent.
   - **Figure 2**: Labels are clear, font size is appropriate, and units are consistent.
   - **Figure 3**: Labels are clear, font size is appropriate, but the units for the Y-axis ("%") could be more prominent.
   - **Consistency**: There is some inconsistency in font size across figures. Legends are present and clear, but the order of items in the legend should be checked to match the order in the graph.

3. **Figure Title**:
   - **Figure 1**: "Efficiency of MPI for OpenMP, Kokkos (serial), and Kokkos (parallel) across cores and thread counts. PlaidVP is most efficient for processes, but one of the least efficient OpenMP/Kokkos. PAPI is the most efficient for OpenMP."
   - **Figure 2**: "Experiment 2: Parallel Code Translation"
   - **Figure 3**: "The expected speedup efficiency across thread counts."
   - **Evaluation**: Figure 1 and Figure 3 have descriptive titles, while Figure 2's title is less descriptive. It should be more specific about what aspect of parallel code translation is being shown.

4. **Key/Legend Order**:
   - The order of the legend items should be checked to ensure they match the order of the bars/lines in the figures. This is not clearly visible in the provided image resolution.

5. **Coloring Scheme and Patterns**:
   - Figures use different colors, but patterns are not used. Adding patterns could help distinguish elements in black and white prints or for colorblind readers.

6. **Figure Captions**:
   - **Figure 1**: Detailed, mentions different libraries and conditions.
   - **Figure 2**: Less detailed, could mention the specific machine or environment.
   - **Figure 3**: Detailed, mentions thread counts.
   - **Suggestions**: Captions for Figure 2 should be more detailed, mentioning the machine, number of processes/cores/GPUs if relevant.

7. **Referenced in Text**:
   - The text should reference these figures and guide the reader on how to interpret them. Without the full text, it's hard to confirm, but ensure each figure is mentioned and explained in the text.

8. **Placement of Figures**:
   - Figures should ideally appear right after they are mentioned in the text. This placement seems appropriate based on the layout shown, but confirmation would require seeing the text context.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:

- Ensure consistency in font sizes across all figures.
- Use patterns in addition to colors for better visibility in different viewing conditions.
- Make Figure 2's title more descriptive.
- Check and ensure the order of legend items matches the order in the graph.
- Add more detail to Figure 2's caption regarding the experimental setup.
- Confirm that each figure is referenced in the text with explanations on how to interpret the data.

Overall, while the figures are informative, there is room for improvement in consistency, clarity, and detail to enhance readability and comprehension.

**page_12**: Based on the provided image of page 12 from the PDF, here is an evaluation of the quality of the figures:

1. **Consistent Style**:
   - The figures (Figure 11 and Figure 12) do not appear to use a consistent style. Figure 11 uses a bar chart format, while Figure 12 uses a line graph format. The visual style, including colors and layout, differs between the two.

2. **X-axis, Y-axis Labels, Legends, and Ticks**:
   - **Figure 11**: 
     - X-axis label: "Number of GPUs" (good)
     - Y-axis label: "Speedup" (good)
     - Font size: Consistent but small, might be hard to read for some.
     - Capitalization: Consistent (title case for labels).
     - Units and terms: Consistent.
     - Legend: Present but the order of items in the legend should match the order of bars in the chart.
   - **Figure 12**:
     - X-axis label: "Number of GPUs" (good)
     - Y-axis label: "Efficiency" (good)
     - Font size: Consistent with Figure 11 but small.
     - Capitalization: Consistent.
     - Units and terms: Consistent.
     - Legend: Present, but again, the order should match the order of lines in the graph.

3. **Figure Title**:
   - Both figures have descriptive titles:
     - Figure 11: "Figure 11: speedup translation compared to ground truth for Translating Problems"
     - Figure 12: "Figure 12: efficiency of translation compared to ground truth for Translating Problems"
   - The titles are descriptive but could be more concise.

4. **Key/Legend Order**:
   - The order of items in the legends does not match the order of bars/lines in the figures. This should be corrected for clarity.

5. **Consistent Coloring Scheme and Patterns**:
   - The coloring scheme is consistent within each figure but not between figures. Adding patterns (e.g., stripes, dots) could help differentiate the data series for color-blind readers.

6. **Figure Captions**:
   - The captions are detailed:
     - Figure 11: Mentions the machine (NVIDIA V100 GPUs), number of GPUs, and context.
     - Figure 12: Similar detail, but could mention the machine explicitly if not clear from the context.
   - Captions are good but could be more specific about the machine if multiple machines are involved.

7. **Reference in Text**:
   - The figures are referenced in the text, but it is not clear from the provided image whether the text explains how to read the figures or what to take away from them. This should be ensured in the full document.

8. **Placement of Figures**:
   - It appears the figures are placed right after they are mentioned in the text, which is good practice.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Ensure consistent visual style across figures (e.g., similar bar chart styles or line graph styles).
- Increase font size for better readability.
- Ensure the order in legends matches the order in the figures.
- Add patterns to differentiate data series alongside colors.
- Make sure the text explicitly guides the reader on how to interpret the figures and what conclusions to draw.
- If multiple machines are used, ensure this is clear in the captions or text.

Overall, the figures are informative but could benefit from these improvements for clarity and consistency.

**page_13**: Based on the provided image of page 13 from the PDF, there are no figures present on this page. It appears to be a page of references or bibliography.

Since there are no figures, I will address each of your criteria in the context of there being no figures:

1. **Do the figures use a consistent style?**
   - Not applicable, as there are no figures.

2. **Check X-axis, Y-axis labels, legends and ticks: font size, capitalization, units and terms used should be consistent across all**

### LLM_Writing

**abstract**: Our results show that while large language models can generate
parallel code, their performance varies significantly depending on the
complexity of the task and the programming model used. We also find that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source models, but the
difference is not always significant. Our findings provide insights into the
capabilities and limitations of large language models for generating parallel
code, and suggest directions for future research.

1. **Spell and grammar check: Pass**
   - The abstract is free of spelling and grammatical errors.

2. **Does the body of the paper use present tense: Pass**
   - The abstract uses the present tense consistently, e.g., "Large language models are increasingly becoming...", "Their ability to model and generate...", "We use \generatebench{} to evaluate...".

3. **Is the tense usage consistent, avoiding frequent switching within the same paragraph: Pass**
   - The tense usage is consistent throughout the abstract, with no switching between tenses.

4. **Is the use of "which" and "that" correctly distinguished: Pass**
   - The abstract does not use "which" or "that", so there is no issue with their distinction.

5. **Are long sentences and passive voice avoided: Pass**
   - The sentences are concise and to the point. There is no use of passive voice; all sentences are in active voice.

6. **Is informal wording avoided: Pass**
   - The abstract uses formal wording throughout, e.g., "demonstrated" instead of "shown", "such as" instead of "like".

7. **Are numbers less than 10 written out as words: Fail**
   - The abstract uses numerals for numbers less than 10, e.g., "420 different coding tasks", "12 different computational problem types", "six different parallel programming models". These should be written out as "four hundred and twenty", "twelve", and "six" respectively.<|eos|>

**Introduction**: The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:background}
provides background on LLMs and parallel programming. Section~\ref{sec:benchmark}
describes the \generatebench{} benchmark in detail. Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}
presents our evaluation methodology and results. Section~\ref{sec:metrics}
introduces our novel metrics for evaluating LLM generated code.
Section~\ref{sec:analysis} analyzes the performance of LLMs on the
\generatebench{} benchmark. Section~\ref{sec:related} discusses related work.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and discusses future
work.

1. **Spell and Grammar Check:**
   - **Pass:** The text is free of spelling and grammatical errors.

2. **Present Tense Usage:**
   - **Pass:** The body of the paper uses present tense consistently, e.g., "Large language model (LLM) based coding tools are becoming popular," "Popular models such as StarCoder span a wide range of programming languages."

3. **Consistent Tense Usage:**
   - **Pass:** The tense usage is consistent throughout the paragraph, with no switching between tenses.

4. **Correct Use of "Which" and "That":**
   - **Pass:** The use of "which" and "that" is correctly distinguished. For example, "tasks, including code completion, summarization, translation, and lookup, that LLMs can perform" would use "that" correctly for defining clauses, while "tasks, such as code completion, which are performed by LLMs" would use "which" correctly for non-defining clauses. The text does not misuse these terms.

5. **Avoidance of Long Sentences and Passive Voice:**
   - **Pass:** The sentences are generally concise and avoid passive voice. For example, "Parallel code is essential to modern software development due to the ubiquity of multi-core processors, GPGPUs, and distributed systems" is a clear, active sentence.

6. **Avoidance of Informal Wording:**
   - **Pass:** The text uses formal wording throughout, such as "demonstrated" instead of "shown," "such as" instead of "like," and "observe" instead of "see."

7. **Numbers Less Than 10 Written Out:**
   - **Pass:** Numbers less than 10 are written out as words, e.g., "seven different execution models."

Overall, the "Introduction" section passes all the criteria listed. The writing is clear, formal, and adheres to the specified guidelines.<|eos|>

5. **Avoidance of Long Sentences and Passive Voice:**
   - **Pass:** The sentences are generally concise and avoid passive voice. For example, "Transformer networks are designed to model sequential data" is active and clear.

6. **Avoidance of Informal Wording:**
   - **Pass:** The text uses formal wording throughout, such as "observe" instead of "see," "demonstrate" instead of "show," and "such as" instead of "like."

7. **Numbers Less Than 10 Written Out:**
   - **Fail:** The text uses numerals for numbers less than 10 in some instances, such as "2017" and "0.2." These should be written out as "two thousand seventeen" and "zero point two" respectively.

Overall, the section "Background" is well-written and adheres to most of the specified criteria, with the exception of the use of numerals for numbers less than 10.<|eos|>

**Related Work**: 1. **Spell and Grammar Check:**
   - **Pass:** The section is free of spelling and grammatical errors.

2. **Present Tense Usage:**
   - **Pass:** The body of the paper uses present tense consistently, e.g., "These models are usually evaluated on code generation tasks."

3. **Consistent Tense Usage:**
   - **Pass:** The tense usage is consistent throughout the section, with no frequent switching within paragraphs.

4. **Correct Use of "Which" and "That":**
   - **Pass:** The use of "which" and "that" is correctly distinguished. For example, "The first of these, HumanEval, is a set of 164 code generation tasks that are designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to write short Python functions" uses "that" correctly to introduce a restrictive clause.

5. **Avoidance of Long Sentences and Passive Voice:**
   - **Fail:** Some sentences are quite long and could be broken down for better readability. For example, "None of these works comprehensively evaluate and compare the ability of LLMs to generate parallel code across a large number of problems, execution models, and LLMs using state-of-the-art evaluation techniques, which is the focus of this work." Additionally, passive voice is used in some instances, such as "These models are usually evaluated on code generation tasks."

6. **Avoidance of Informal Wording:**
   - **Pass:** The section avoids informal wording, using terms like "evaluate" instead of "check," "demonstrate" instead of "show," and "such as" instead of "like."

7. **Numbers Less Than 10 Written Out as Words:**
   - **Fail:** The section does not consistently write out numbers less than 10 as words. For example, "18 programming languages" should be "eighteen programming languages."

Overall, the section is well-written but could benefit from breaking down long sentences and using active voice more consistently. Additionally, numbers less than 10 should be written out as words to adhere to standard academic writing practices.<|eos|>

**\generatebench{**: <|eos|>

**Description of Evaluation Experiments**: 1. **Spell and Grammar Check:**
   - **Pass:** The text is free of spelling and grammatical errors.

2. **Present Tense Usage:**
   - **Fail:** The text uses a mix of present and past tense. For example, "We evaluate LLMs" (present tense) and "We evaluated several prompting formats" (past tense). The paper should consistently use present tense for describing the experiments.

3. **Consistent Tense Usage:**
   - **Fail:** The tense usage is not consistent. The text switches between present and past tense within the same section, which can be confusing. For example, in Experiment 2, "We prompt the LLM" (present tense) and "We evaluated several prompting formats" (past tense) are used in the same paragraph.

4. **Correct Use of "Which" and "That":**
   - **Pass:** The text correctly distinguishes between "which" and "that." For example, "We evaluate LLMs on how well they can generate code for all the prompts in \generatebench{}, which we do by asking the model to complete the function started in the prompt" uses "which" correctly to introduce a non-restrictive clause.

5. **Avoidance of Long Sentences and Passive Voice:**
   - **Fail:** The text contains some long sentences and uses passive voice. For example, "The metrics are computed over the combined results from the OpenMP, MPI, MPI+OpenMP, Kokkos, CUDA, and HIP execution models, and compared with the same metrics computed over the serial results" is a long sentence. Additionally, "An example of this prompt format is shown in \Cref{lst:translation-prompt}" uses passive voice.

6. **Avoidance of Informal Wording:**
   - **Pass:** The text uses formal wording throughout. For example, "evaluate" instead of "check," "demonstrate" instead of "show," and "such as" instead of "like."

7. **Numbers Less Than 10 Written Out as Words:**
   - **Fail:** The text does not consistently write out numbers less than 10 as words. For example, "1" in "Experiment 1" and "2" in "Experiment 2" are written as numerals instead of "one" and "two."

Overall, the section needs some revisions to meet all the criteria, particularly in terms of tense consistency and sentence structure.<|eos|>

**Models used for Comparison**: However, we include them in our evaluation as they are
widely considered to be amongst the best performing LLMs available.
